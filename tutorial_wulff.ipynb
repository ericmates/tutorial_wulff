    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Slab models\n",
    "One could argue that the physical definition of a molecule is relatively simple: a delimited cluster of bonded atoms, each characterised by a set of spatial coordinates. Representing a model of a molecule, therefore, is a conceptually straightforward task. Many atomic structures, however, are not molecules but _crystals_, large arrangements of atoms which are closely packed together and distributed in a patterned fashion, displaying motifs of a repeating unit (_unit cell_) throughout the structure. Due to the vast number of atoms forming the crystal (there are ca. 10<sup>18</sup> atoms in a grain of salt), it is usually more feasible to consider them not as an immense structure with an orderly distribution of atoms and defined edges surrounded by vacuum (a _cluster model_), but rather as an infinite surface with a given periodicity, which simplifies the calculations to study these materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This surface structure can be constructed from a conventional unit cell (as shown in Figure 1 A, which is expanded into a (3√ó3√ó3) supercell‚Äîformed by 27 conventional unit cells‚Äîin Figure 1 B) by cleaving the crystal structure along a _(hkl)_ lattice plane (Figure 1 C) parallel to the terminating surface plane, and including a number of atomic layers within a set distance from this plane. To enable periodicity along the **√¢<sub>1</sub>** and **√¢<sub>2</sub>** directions, the surface structure is then aligned so that the vector orthogonal to the surface plane is parallel to **√¢<sub>3</sub>** ; furthermore, a vacuum is included along this axis to minimise the interactions between neighbouring unit cells in that direction. The resulting structure (Figure 1 D) is denoted as a surface _slab model_, which is periodic along 2 of the axes and is able to describe the geometry of the interface (as opposed to the _bulk model_ in Figure 1 A).\n",

    "### Wulff constructions\n",
    "An essential aspect to consider when simulating crystals representing nanoparticles is that, in reality, these structures usually expose not one, but many surface facets onto which chemical processes can occur. Therefore, an accurate assessment of these systems must start with a precise determination of the lattice planes that are likely to conform the nanoparticles, which will be inherently governed by their morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of geometry in heterogeneous systems was first discussed by Willard Gibbs between 1875 to 1878. In his 1876 publication as part of the complete work On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances, he introduced the concept of **_neutral equilibrium_** to define the state at which a heterogeneous system, in contact with a liquid phase, **maximises the entropy and minimises the surface tension of the exposed facets**. Therefore, he theorised that as a particulate system approaches equilibrium, **it converges to a polyhedric structure displaying a limited number of lattice planes**, in crystallographic systems, represented by Miller indices _(hkl)_. The mathematical interpretation of this principle (the Gibbs‚ÄìWulff theorem) was later developed by George Wulff, who suggested that the shape of particles in neutral equilibrium can be envisioned as **the volume inside all crystal planes (hkl), at a distance _h<sub>hkl</sub>_ from the centre which is proportional to the surface energy of the lattice plane**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_{hkl}=c \\cdot \\gamma_{hkl}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, _c_ is an arbitrary constant, and $\\gamma_{hkl}$ is the surface energy of the plane, **the energy per unit area required to create a slab with a terminal lattice plane of Miller indices _(hkl)_ from a bulk structure of the crystal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma_{hkl}=\\frac{E_{slab}-NE_{bulk}}{2A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $E_{slab}$ is the electronic energy of the slab, $E_{bulk}$ is the energy of the starting bulk material, ùê¥ is the area of the resulting slab, and ùëÅ is the number of bulk units included in the slab, also defined as $N=N^{slab}_{atoms}/N^{bulk}_{atoms}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium shape of the crystal particle is, therefore, **a function of the relative surface energies of all represented lattice planes**, and it can be constructed by only knowing the Miller indices of these planes and their surface energies (Figure 2 A). This methodology, known as a Wulff construction, yields 3-D polyhedrons with the same morphology as the nanoparticles defined by those Miller indices and surface energies (Figure 2 B), and allows us to predict, for a certain nanoparticle, **which surfaces will be exposed and may promote chemical processes**.\n",

    "## Practice\n",
    "Without further ado, we shall begin our journey to predict the shape of a given nanoparticle and build an atomic representation of how this nanoparticle will look like. This tutorial is divided in 4 steps:\n",
    "- Construction of the bulk structure of a metal and calculation of the bulk energy ($E_{bulk}$).\n",
    "- Generation of the surfaces with various Miller indices and calculation of the surface energy ($E_{slab}$).\n",
    "- Calculation of the surface energy ($\\gamma_{hkl}$) using the equation above.\n",
    "- Generation and visualization of the models for the Wulff construction and the atomic nanoparticle.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will achieve this by making use of the Atomic Simulation Environment and the Wulffpack python libraries (**run the snippets by clicking the _Run_ button at the top**). Although we will be using python throughout the session, no prior coding knowledge is required."
